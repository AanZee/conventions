## Contribute
Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request. To structure our conventions and to keep them readable we use the following standards:
- For pull requests we create feature branches based on develop (i.e. feature/feature-name).
- Conventions are written in Markdown
- When writing conventions, describe how things should be done and not how they should not be done (e.g. 'Write HTML and content on new lines' instead of 'Do not write HTML and content on a single line').
- Write imperative sentences for titles that describe a convention (e.g. 'Add type to button elements' instead of 'Type is added to button elements')
- Only use headings when you need to group content, do not use headings without content only to structure the text.
